Movie Review Sentiment Classification

Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify customer reviews as positive or negative using IMDb Reviews dataset. The project covers data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, and evaluation.

Steps

1. Data Collection

Used the publicly available IMDb Reviews dataset for sentiment classification.

2. Data Preprocessing

Cleaned text data by removing unnecessary characters, digits, and stop words.

Converted text to lowercase and tokenized it into words.

3. Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features.

Chose TF-IDF over Bag of Words due to its ability to reduce the importance of frequent but less meaningful words.

4. Model Selection and Training

Implemented the following classification models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine

Performed an 80/20 train-test split.

Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.

5. Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% (replace with actual results).

Future Improvements

Experiment with deep learning models like LSTMs and Transformers.

Expand the dataset for better generalization.
